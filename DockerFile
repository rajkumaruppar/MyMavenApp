# Step 1: Use an official Maven image to build the application
FROM maven:3.9.9-openjdk-11-slim AS build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 2: Copy the pom.xml and the source code to the container
COPY pom.xml ./
COPY src ./src

# Step 3: Build the project with Maven (it will generate a WAR or JAR file in the target folder)
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Step 4: Use the official Tomcat image as the base for running the application
FROM tomcat:9-jdk11-openjdk

# Step 5: Set the working directory for Tomcat
WORKDIR /usr/local/tomcat/webapps

# Step 6: Copy the WAR file (generated in the build stage) to Tomcat's webapps folder
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war

# Step 7: Expose port 8000 (Tomcat default port will be changed to 8000 as per previous step)
EXPOSE 8000

# Step 8: Update Tomcat's server.xml to use port 8000 instead of the default 8080
RUN sed -i 's/8080/8000/g' /usr/local/tomcat/conf/server.xml

# Step 9: Start Tomcat when the container is run
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
