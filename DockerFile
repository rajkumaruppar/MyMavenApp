# Step 1: Use Maven to build the project
FROM maven:3.8.6-openjdk-17-slim AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Maven POM file and the source code
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src

# Build the application and create the WAR file (skip tests for faster build)
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Step 2: Use Tomcat as a base image to run the app
FROM tomcat:9-jdk17-slim

# Set the working directory in the Tomcat container
WORKDIR /usr/local/tomcat/webapps

# Copy the WAR file from the build stage to Tomcat's webapps folder
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/app.war

# Expose the default port for Tomcat
EXPOSE 8080

# Run Tomcat when the container starts
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
